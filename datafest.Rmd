## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Reading in Data & Merging destination data with 1% of (US) data 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
dest <- read.table('data/dest.txt', sep="\t", header = T, quote = "")
data_sample <- read.table('data/data.1.percent.txt', sep="\t", header = T, quote = "")
merged_data <- merge(dest, data_sample, by = 'srch_destination_id')
```

## Heatmap of popular travel activities 
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
popular = as.matrix(dest[,7:dim(dest)[2]])
rnames <- Dest$srch_destination_name
rownames(popular) <- rnames

Dest_hm <- heatmap(popular[0:10,0:4], Rowv = NA, Colv = NA, col = cm.colors(250), 
                   scale = "column")
```
## Correlation between frequency of user location and frequency of hotel location
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
